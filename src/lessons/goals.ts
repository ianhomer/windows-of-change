  notes: `
- North Star ; Odyssey ; Quest ; Goal ; Change ; Task
- layer from north star alignment
- breaking down changes
- sequencing changes
- scale
  - **alignment** / north star
  - "misson" / quarter
  - **goal** / outcome / value / feature / week
  - **change** / output / something that impacts end user / bug fix / day
  - task / decision / improve / pay back debt / hour
- mindfully take debt ; mindfully choose when to pay it back - pay off credit
  card bill every month.
- change = change of state; messages to user ; code changes ; platform change ;
    system
  - **diagram** thing / state / signals out / platform / environment / layers ;
    where can you effect change?
- task to make change or make change easier
- More than a work board ; try to not constrain thinking to how this is entered
  in e.g. a JIRA work board. More important to correct alignment of flow of work 
  than to fight with tools.
- Not about task management
  - it's about aligning things / changes and actions ; things we do / decisions
    we make, whereever ; however.
